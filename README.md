# A Good README Generator

![License:MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

## Description

 Whenever you create a project, it is very important to give users and potential users a quality README with some information about your project. Some examples you could include are a title, a description, how to install and how to use your program, how to run tests, what license is associated with your program, how to contribute, and information about the creator; like a GitHub username and email they can be reached at for questions. Luckily for you, this generator does just that. So don't worry about how much time a good quality README will take you to put together. Focus on your project and let this generator do the work.
